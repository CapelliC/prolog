*** plsmf - MIDI file reading from SWI Prolog
***

This module allows Prolog code to read and write standard
MIDI files (SMFs). Uses libsmf.


PREREQUISITES

- SWI Prolog
- libsmf
- glib-2.0


INSTALLATION

The Makefile uses pkg-config to find glib.
I don't have a good way of finding libsmf, so currently, this is
hardcoded to /usr/local. If this is not correct, you must edit the
Makefile before building.

Then use SWI Prolog pack_install/1. 


USAGE

This is the sort of thing that might work for you. (It is up to
you to manage the connection references returned by midi_mk_outlet/2.)

:- use_module(library(plsmf)).


CHANGE LOG
