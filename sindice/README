This package provides an interface to the Sindice semantic web search engine.

---++++ Simple usage

The simplest way to use this module is to call si_with_result/5. The last
argument is an ordinary Prolog goal that will be called with the 4th argument
bound to the URI of a search result stored in a temporary named graph.
Progress is bound to a term Current/Total which says how far through the
result set we are. Multi-page result sets are managed transparently.

?- use_module(library(sindice)).
?- si_with_result(keyword(coltrane),[],Progress,Res,si_facet(Res,Facet)).
?- si_with_result(keywords([coltrane,monk]),[fields([cache])],Progress,Res,si_facet(Res,cache(Cache))).

---++++ Planned enhancements

* A query language similar to that implemented in lucene.pl (part of the musicbrainz package).
* A means to load and query the cache URL corresponding to a search result.
